# Basic Food Game

Extremely simple game where you gather food so you don't die. Made with (React)[https://github.com/jsdotlua/react-lua] and (Rodux)[https://github.com/Roblox/rodux]. Made for a take-home interview project.

To run the project, clone the repository, then run:

```bash
aftman install
wally install

```

Then, open `game.rbxl` in Studio.
