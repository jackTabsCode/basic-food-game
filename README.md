# Basic Food Game

Extremely simple game where you gather food so you don't die. Made with [React](https://github.com/jsdotlua/react-lua) and [Rodux](https://github.com/Roblox/rodux). Made for a take-home interview project.

To run the project, clone the repository, then run:

```bash
aftman install
wally install
rojo build -o "game.rbxl"
```

Then, open `game.rbxl` in Studio.

## Note
I don't really stand by the server-side OOP code that I wrote for this project, but it was simple to reason about at the time. This project is mainly open source to demonstrate how you can work with React and Rodux in an actual game.
